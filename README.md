# Tide-Prediction
In this project, I have created a model which can predict the future 12 hours water level with the help of machine learning algorithm Linear Regression. The data is of Bob Hall Pier station which is in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Future prediction for next 24 hours can be achieved by changing the frequency to 24 from 12.
